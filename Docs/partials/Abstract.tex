\section*{Abstract}

Our goal is to replicate and test the authentication protocol for NFC tags from the paper “Secure and Lightweight Authentication  Protocol for NFC Tag Based Services”. This authentication protocol relies on the client’s device being able to read what was previously stored on the NFC Tag and replace it with new information from the server so that the tag can be authenticated again. A concern with this protocol is that the tag information can be overwritten by a third party as most NFC Tags are unable to authenticate before being written to. We plan on testing this by creating multiple tags that have been previously authenticated, then attempt to overwrite them by using an Android device running the NFCTools app publicly available in the Google Play store to attempt a Denial of Service (DoS) Attack. Once the tags have been overwritten, they can no longer be authenticated resulting in the inability to access the tag until an administrator re-adds the tag to the system.
